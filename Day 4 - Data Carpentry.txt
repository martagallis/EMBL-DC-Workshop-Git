Data analysis with applications to genomics
Gaurav Diwan


For loop  ---> each value in the vector will be run (with the code insidde curly brakets) as loop 

Full Join will combine every column possible between 2 tables, and fill NA where value is unavailable

Inner Join will combine only the rows that have information on both tables

Left Join will keep table x intact and add only rows from y that have correspondent values available in x rows

Non-finite values warning message ---> log10(0) is -inf, so all 0 values corresponding rows were removed

log10(1) = 0, we can take advantage of this. Or change every value by adding +1 (since in this case the values are so large that 1 will not change the overwall assessment)

Minute is a category in this example so we factor it!




Data analysis with applications to genomics - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

Matrix can only be one type, typically numbers

t() transpose function

ggplot wants tibble for data formats

Use PCA as a first screen but it can't tell us significant directly relatable analysis
