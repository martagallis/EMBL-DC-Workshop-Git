Never modify original data. Create data_raw to keep the files there. Never override it. New modificed files can be kept in data folder


Command: dir.create("fig")  ---> creates folder
Command: ?dir.create        ---> opens help pane for that specific function

<-                          ---> assign operator, assign a value to an object, shortcut: Alt + -

Object names can't start with a number. Avoid dots. They should be short and self-explanotory. Can't use reserved words (gramatics such as if; or; for; and)

R is case sensitive

#                           ---> comment signaling

A function is a series of commands to be executed as a block

Command: args(function)     ---> show of function arguments

Vector will be a series of objects/values of the same type

Use na.rm inside function to remove NA values

A data frame is the structure designed to contain your data. It is a collection of vectors that make up a column. All the columns need to have the same size.

Factor type of data only available in R.  Factors are a limited of different values/levels in a column.

Command: summary(vector/factor/table) ---> counts and statistics on data
