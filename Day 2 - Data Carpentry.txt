Versioning with Git - Fotis Psomopoulos

IDE - Integrated Development Environment

Git is a system that allows to keep track of changes (in versions of documents) in an effective way

Each repository on GitHub is an equivalent to a project

Common Creative license or MIT license (supporting open source)

When in R studio, in top right quadrant, Git tab, if you check boxes, you are telling GitHub to track your changes on that specific file/code/project
We commit (sutab) to save them.
We can viw list of commits (changes), in Git tab, History subtab, top right quadrant.
Diff subtab will tell you the differences of your new written code comparing to the one you had written

If we want to run commands, while doing something else, we open terminal tab on bottom left quadrant

When making changes, you can have 3 versions of the same file: personal, bankteller and vault. Move between staged and unstaged in commit window to check all the versions and choose which one to save/commit.

	Not sure of differences between staged and unstaged, why does staged saves file to git and 	disapears from top right quadrant but unstaged seems to keep it there to be tracked?

	Do we always need github to be open while using R studio?

"Push" to save everything on Github
